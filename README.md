A computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.
## Why?
Pneumonia affects many individuals, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations, where high levels of pollution, unhygienic living conditions, and overcrowding are relatively common, together with inadequate medical infrastructure. According to a study in 2015, among the 5.9 million deaths of children under 5, over 15.6% were due to pneumonia. Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to ensure curative treatment and increase survival rates. Chest X-rays which are primarily used for the diagnosis of this disease need expert radiotherapists for evaluation. Thus, developing an automatic system for detecting pneumonia would be beneficial for treating the disease without any delay particularly in remote areas. It could also aid radiologists in their decision making process.
